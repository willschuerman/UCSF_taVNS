# UCSF_taVNS
Information and code for conducting and analyzing taVNS experiments.

This repository contains code for running taVNS experiments using Matlab and Python. 
- The Matlab code is easily editable for creating simple, custom experiments and doing testing (equipment, thresholds, etc...)
- The Python code utilizes Psychopy for generating more complex experiments combining taVNS with tasks and audio/visual stimuli. 

The repository also contains information on
- The equipment utilized by the UCSF Chang Lab to carry out taVNS experiments. 
- Procedures for preparing participants for taVNS studies. 
- Safety information, primarily in the form of checklists, for both researchers and participants.
